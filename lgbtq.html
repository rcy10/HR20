        <h1>LGBTQ+</h1>
            <p>This community has been striving for equality, not just in law, but in their everyday lives. 
               All deserve a life that they can live without fear of being true their self and discriminated against
               due to their sexual or gender orientation.
               Though rights are steadily improving, there are still locations all over the globe where being LGBTQ+ people 
               are being imprisoned or even put to death.
               This is not a local issue, but a global one.
            </p>
            <br>
        <h2>What is being done?</h2>
        <p>
            More and more people are joining this community and more non-LGBTQ+ are showing their support.
            There has been significant progress over the past decade alone.  The <a target = "_blank" rel = "noopener" href = "https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Discrimination/Pages/LGBTUNResolutions.aspx">UN's involvement</a>
            sparked the movement and its support has been growing stronger with the community.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h2>What can you do?</h2>
        <p>There are plenty of organizations that could use your support.  Together, we can fight against discrimination and bigotry.
