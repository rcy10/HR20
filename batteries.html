        <h1>Batteries and EVs</h1>

        <h2>Why are batteries the future when my phone doesn't last a day on a single charge?</h2>

        <p>Current battery technology finds us recharging our phones nearly every day. Why is that? Well, for one, the capabilities of technology have increased faster than the energy density of batteries. Energy density is how much energy a battery is able to store in a given size. The current lithium-ion battery technology in vehicles is already quite impressive. Currently, the Tesla Model S P100 can travel nearly 400 miles on a single charge owing to the fact that it has a large battery (100 kWh), low drag coefficient to help it glide throught he air more efficiently, and regenerative braking which reduces energy consumption and improves brake lifetime. You may be thinking to yourself, well there are gas cars that can travel further! Yes, that is true, however the average range of gas powered cars is <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/fact-939-august-22-2016-all-electric-vehicle-ranges-can-exceed-those-some-gasoline" target="_blank">412 miles</a>, not far off from the Tesla Model S P100. The main downside is cost. To get a Tesla Model S P100 brand new, will cost you around $100,000. We're sure that you've heard of Tesla though, right? That's no accident. Tesla has pushed to become a household name so that they can push other companies to invest money into electric vehicles (EVs).</p>
        <p>This effort has largely been a success. As of 2020, many companies are pushing to develop their own electric car to compete with Tesla. Do you remember the energy density issue I presented before? Well what do you think will happen to a little known research area if giant companies like Ford, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and others start investing on making the longest range cars possible? Batteries will inevitably get better just like the internal combustion engine that powers your car right now got better throughout the 20th century into a powertrain that can travel upwards of 40 miles on a single gallong of gasoline. Competition and research by these large companies will produce more and more dense batteries, produce new chemistries, and possibly even one day be the source of energy for planes!</p>
        <h2>Well, aren't they just getting their energy from coal anyways?</h2>
        <p>That answer really depends on where you live. Many places are starting to transition to renewable energy (more on that later). While it is true that some states in the US will be producing their electricity through coal or natural gas, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014" target="_blank">as of 2014, transportation accounted for 26%</a> of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US and 28% of economic sector emissions. Most of these emissions don't from passenger vehicles but from transportation of goods. Now imagine if truckers were hauling goods with vehicles that had zero emissions? While we still have a long way to go, it's not impossible and may be nearer than you think.</p>
        <h2>What does the future of battery technology look like?</h2>
        <p>In the near future, look for battery technology to continue to increase in density and possibly for some new chemistries.
