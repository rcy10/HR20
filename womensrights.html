        <h1>Gender Equality</h1>

        <h2>Where are we at?</h2>

        <p>Roughly half of the world's population are women but for some reason they are often not treated the same as men. <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/07/07/a-century-after-women-gained-the-right-to-vote-majority-of-american"target="_blank">This poll</a> by the Pew Research Center published on July 7th, 2020 shows that the public believes that there is work to be done on gender equality. There is definitely work to be done. Women are routinely sexually harrassed, put down, and told they are not as qualified as their male counterparts. Women are routinely discourage to pursue STEM fields due to the outdated belief that they can't do it. Women are fired for being pregnant despite the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978.</p>
        <p>Many men think that just because natural differences exist between men and women that men are superior. This is a dangerous mindset that has circulated on male dominated forums and through some people's cultures. Just because women and men are different does not mean that one is better than the other. Men are more likely than women to be aggressive, a factor that causes women to have to be afraid to walk alone. How can we have equality when men's aggression towards women just gets brushed under the rug? In 2009, the Department of Justice found that women were 5 times more likely to be victims of intimate partner violence (<a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv10.pdf">source</a>). </p>
