        <h2>About This Site</h2>

        <p>This site is being created by Ryan Smith and Ryan York for HackRice 2020. Our goal with this website is to bring as many reliable sources to you as possible and to help unpack the information presented.</p>
        <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
        <p>All around the world, we are seeing unprecendented changes brought on by the consumption of fossil fuels. While fossil fuels have fueled the growth of the world, we and many others believe that humans can do better. There are plenty of people that are currently working on creating better technologies such as electric cars, solar panels, hydroelectric generators, and wind turbines. These all have ways to go but as we'll talk about in other parts of the site, major leaps have been made by dedicated teams.</p>
        <p>One thing that we want you to keep in mind while you browse our site: while some of these advances may seem small, small steps over time accumulate. Making these small steps every year has led to technologies that couldn't have been imagined even 100 years ago. We hope that our site will help you be more patient and understand how difficult these changes are. The 20th century featured so many large jumps in technological advances that many people think that that's how advances are supposed to be made. Please, be patient, and know that there are brilliant people all around the world working on making tomorrow better for everyone.</p>
