        <h2>About This Site</h2>

        <p1>This site is being created by Ryan Smith and Ryan York for HackRice 2020. Our mission with  this website is to help you understand what climate change is and how it impact people throughout the world. Our goal with this website is to bring as many reliable sources to you as possible and to help unpack the information presented.</p1>
        <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
        <p1>All around the world, we are seeing unprecendented changes brought on by the consumption of fossil fuels. While fossil fuels have fueled the growth of the world, we and many others believe that humans can do better. There are plenty of people that are currently working on creating better technologies such as electric cars, solar panels, hydroelectric generators, and wind turbines. These all have ways to go but as we'll talk about in other parts of the site, major leaps have been made by dedicated teams.</p1>
