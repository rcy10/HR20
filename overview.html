        <h1>What is climate change?</h1>
        <h2>Climate Change Defined</h2>
        <p>Climate change is a complex topic but is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-climate-change-k4.html" target="_blank"> generally defined</a> as the change in usual weather in a place. Typically, when climate change is mentioned with regards to global warming, the climate change that is being mentioned is global climate change. The real key is that climate change metrics depend on the scope. In other words, climate change is both for local weather and global conditions. Generally speaking, the climate change referred to on this website will be with respect to the change in the global climate, unless local climate is specifically mentioned.</p>
        <h2>What does this have to do with people?</h2>
        <p>Climate change is a serious issue that has already been making lives worse for millions of people. For instance, Los Angeles has been <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/progress-smog-los-angeles#stream/0" target="_blank">actively working on improving</a> their air quality over the past several decades.</p>
